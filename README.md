FAQ
===

Will this log information on my Application?
-------------------------
No. The only data we store is the data you give us, you have full control of what data you send to our servers.

Will there be more official wrappers?
-------------------------
Yes. We are currently working on our Native wrapper as well as our wrapper for python.

What is Premium?
-------------------------
Slice if free to use and anyone can sign up, however it does come with some drawbacks. Free users have limitations on how much of our server they can use and restrictions on how many of one thing they're allowed to create on our panel. Premium unlocks these limits and allows you to authenticate without limitation!


Reporting bugs to support
-------------------
You can submit a bug report on our online panel. Please taking the following into account:
- Our team is very small and we run this project in our free time.
- Due to our small support team, please narrow down your issue as much as possible.
    - Saying things like "it doesn't work" and "i have an error" don't help us.
- Specify the type of issue the bug is and how to reproduce it.

Be aware this is a **BETA**. Sometimes you may encounter errors and won't know how to fix them, please be patient, we most likely are aware of them and are trying to fix them.
